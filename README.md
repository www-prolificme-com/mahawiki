### About 30 Days coding challenge.

For newbies in tech world who have the caliber and need a master platform to excel in their skills of interest,
ProlificMe team in association with GirlScript Nashik, has organized The Knowledge Worth Sharing - MahaWiki's National level 
Maha Coding Contest for the very first time in India.

Mahawiki's 30 days online coding contest primarily emphasizes on various technologies/programming languages
and designing that includes C, Cpp, Java, Python, Web Development, prototyping and so on. 
Our primary motto is to help an individual to develop problem solving and logical reasoning skills
by sharpening the knowledge of data structures and algorithmns, 
that is gained during their learning curve in college. Through this activity, 
ProlificMe team is trying to identify the brilliant coding geeks from various 
engineering colleges across various Tier-2 and Tier-3 cities.

###  [The Python Challenge-II](Python-Challenge-II/README.md)
      

Question |Problem  |
------------ | ------------ 
Question 1 | Given an array of 99 integers between 1-100, find the missing integer. No integer is repeated and only one integer is missing. (Preferably do it in a single pass,or max. 3 passes) (Code must be most optimised, for time and space complexity. 
Question 2 | Write a function to count the occurence of all characters occuring in 2 given strings consisting of letters only. For example, String 1 is "Surgical Strike" and string 2 is "by Indian Army", it should print the occurence of every letter say S=2, U=1,R=3,G=1,I=4 etc.
Question 3 | Given a range, print the output in the following fashion as given in the example. Range : 1 100 Print : 1 99 2 98 3 97 4 96 5 95 ...
